		description: "Mike has been working with my two girls on math for a few weeks now.  He is a very great teacher and my girls are telling me that they really feel like they understand the concepts well for the first time. The biggest help has been that my oldest was really lacking in confidence in math, but now she looks forward to sessions with Mike. He has helped to build  her up, so that she is now able to focus on doing math only and not on how terrible she thinks she is at it. This has been a life saver for me! He's really skilled at facilitating different learning levels during shared sessions.",

		description: "I've worked with many educators, but very few who are as encouraging, thorough, and as passionate as Mike. He enters every tutoring session seemingly excited for math, and with a few positive fist-bumps along the way, improves my son's attitude and abilities. Our family greatly appreciates Mike's knowledge, patience, and spirit for hard work!",

		description: "Mike tutored my 17 year old Junior with math and English. He is extremely knowledgeable, personable, engaging, and funny to boot!  Mike took time to understand the learning style that worked best for my daughter and where she was missing information and process so that he could help course correct and guide her to the next level. My daughter takes her education seriously and Mike was able to help her reach her goal of achieving straight A’s. I highly recommend Mike as a tutor, he did not disappoint and we are eager to work with him again through the summer and my daughter’s Senior year! Thank you Mike, you saved the semester!!",

		description: "Mike has been helping our son with 7th grade advanced math.  He does an outstanding job and is worthy of our strongest possible recommendation.  Not only does he work well with our son on the lesson content, but also reinforces things like writing neatly, being organized, and showing work steps.  He is an enthusiastic advocate for learning in general, helping my son to see the long term value of dedicating himself to doing well in school.",

		description: "Mike was phenomenal, he helped me ace a calculus class that I had been continually struggling in. He was always there to support me every step of the way with his one-on-one tutoring. I could not have asked for a better tutor. I have a learning disability, he was consistence, reliable, professional, experience and supportive.  His project, Learnhall, is a stepping stone that encourages people to strive in learning and excelling in a variety of subjects.",
